# Getting and Cleaning Data - Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Getting and Cleaning Data project! In this project, I'll demonstrate how to collect, clean, and prepare a data set for analysis. My goal is to transform raw data into tidy data that can be easily used for further analysis.

## Files

Here's a quick overview of the files included in this project:

- **`run_analysis.R`**: This is the R script that performs the data cleaning and analysis.
- **`CodeBook.md`**: This file describes the variables, the data, and the transformations we applied.
- **`tidy_data.txt`**: The final tidy data set generated by our script.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project and how everything fits together.

## How to Use

To get started with this project, I followed these simple steps:

1. **Download and unzip the dataset**: Make sure you have the dataset downloaded and unzipped in your working directory. You can find the dataset [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

2. **Run the `run_analysis.R` script**: This script will:
   - Merge the training and test sets to create one comprehensive data set.
   - Extract measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
   - Apply descriptive activity names to the data set.
   - Label the data set with descriptive variable names.
   - Create a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

3. **Generate the tidy data set**: Running the script will save the tidy data set as `tidy_data.txt` in the working directory.

## Dependencies

Before running the script, make sure to have the `dplyr` package installed. Install it using the following command:

```R
install.packages("dplyr")
