# Code Book

Welcome to the Code Book for my tidy data set! This data was collected from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone and has been cleaned and processed to make it ready for analysis.

## Data Set Information

This data set includes information collected from the accelerometers on Samsung Galaxy S smartphones. The data has been cleaned up and combined to make it ready for analysis. The original data can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

## Variables

Here’s a quick guide to the variables in the tidy data set. All measurements are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]. 

- **`subject`**: The ID of the person who performed the activity (ranges from 1 to 30).
- **`activity`**: The activity performed by the subject. It can be one of the following:
  - WALKING
  - WALKING_UPSTAIRS
  - WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
  - SITTING
  - STANDING
  - LAYING

### Measurement Variables

All measurement variables are averaged for each subject and activity. The following are the measurement variables, their units, and summaries:

- **`tBodyAcc-mean()-X`**, **`tBodyAcc-mean()-Y`**, **`tBodyAcc-mean()-Z`**: Mean values of body acceleration signals in the X, Y, and Z directions. Units: Standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- **`tBodyAcc-std()-X`**, **`tBodyAcc-std()-Y`**, **`tBodyAcc-std()-Z`**: Standard deviation values of body acceleration signals in the X, Y, and Z directions. Units: Standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

- **`tGravityAcc-mean()-X`**, **`tGravityAcc-mean()-Y`**, **`tGravityAcc-mean()-Z`**: Mean values of gravity acceleration signals in the X, Y, and Z directions. Units: Standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- **`tGravityAcc-std()-X`**, **`tGravityAcc-std()-Y`**, **`tGravityAcc-std()-Z`**: Standard deviation values of gravity acceleration signals in the X, Y, and Z directions. Units: Standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

- **`tBodyAccJerk-mean()-X`**, **`tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y`**, **`tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z`**: Mean values of body acceleration jerk signals in the X, Y, and Z directions. Units: Standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- **`tBodyAccJerk-std()-X`**, **`tBodyAccJerk-std()-Y`**, **`tBodyAccJerk-std()-Z`**: Standard deviation values of body acceleration jerk signals in the X, Y, and Z directions. Units: Standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

- **`tBodyGyro-mean()-X`**, **`tBodyGyro-mean()-Y`**, **`tBodyGyro-mean()-Z`**: Mean values of body gyroscope signals in the X, Y, and Z directions. Units: Standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- **`tBodyGyro-std()-X`**, **`tBodyGyro-std()-Y`**, **`tBodyGyro-std()-Z`**: Standard deviation values of body gyroscope signals in the X, Y, and Z directions. Units: Standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

- **`tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-X`**, **`tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Y`**, **`tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Z`**: Mean values of body gyroscope jerk signals in the X, Y, and Z directions. Units: Standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- **`tBodyGyroJerk-std()-X`**, **`tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Y`**, **`tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Z`**: Standard deviation values of body gyroscope jerk signals in the X, Y, and Z directions. Units: Standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

- **`tBodyAccMag-mean()`**, **`tBodyAccMag-std()`**: Mean and standard deviation values of body acceleration magnitude. Units: Standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- **`tGravityAccMag-mean()`**, **`tGravityAccMag-std()`**: Mean and standard deviation values of gravity acceleration magnitude. Units: Standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- **`tBodyAccJerkMag-mean()`**, **`tBodyAccJerkMag-std()`**: Mean and standard deviation values of body acceleration jerk magnitude. Units: Standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- **`tBodyGyroMag-mean()`**, **`tBodyGyroMag-std()`**: Mean and standard deviation values of body gyroscope magnitude. Units: Standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- **`tBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()`**, **`tBodyGyroJerkMag-std()`**: Mean and standard deviation values of body gyroscope jerk magnitude. Units: Standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

(Include additional variables if present in the data set, following the same format.)

## Steps and Transformations

Here’s a breakdown of the steps I took to clean and tidy the data:

1. **Merged the training and test datasets**: Combined data from the training and test sets to create one big data set.
2. **Extracted measurements on the mean and standard deviation**: Selected only the measurements that represent the mean and standard deviation for each signal.
3. **Applied descriptive activity names**: Replaced activity IDs with descriptive names.
4. **Labeled the data set with descriptive variable names**: Renamed the variables to be more readable and meaningful.
5. **Created a tidy data set**: Generated a second data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Final Thoughts

I hope this Code Book makes it clear how the data was processed and what each variable represents. If you have any questions or need further clarification, don’t hesitate to ask!

Enjoy exploring the data!
